# [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + OPConnect Example

This is a simple example of how to implement OPConnect for full user authentication and profiles.

## Running the example

- Please copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the values
- You'll want to set up an environment variable called `SESSION_SECRET` â€” a randomly generated, strong password of at least 32 characters
